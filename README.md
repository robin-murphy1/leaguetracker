# League Rankings Tracker

## Description

The "League Rankings Tracker"(LRT) is a Java console application that ingests data either by uploading a file 
or entering the data on command line. Once all the data has been uploaded LRT will then process
the data and display the results of the team rankings. For each match played a team will be allocated 3 pts for a win 1 pt for a draw and o 
pts for a loss.  
The results will be ordered from the highest to lowest ranking. If teams have same rankings the teams will be alphabetically
ordered  

### Pre-requisites

* mvn >= 3.02
 
### Install application
Download the source from github <https://github.com/robin-murphy1/leaguetracker.git>
``` 
git clone https://github.com/robin-murphy1/leaguetracker.git
```
From the PROJECT_HOME dir run mvn package to generate an executable jar file
```$xslt
mvn clean package
```
Location of artifact will be found in PROJECT_HOME/target/LeagueTracker-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar


### Run the app
Although LRT has been built & tested in a MacOS/Linux platform, the executable jar has been built with
it's dependencies & has been tested on a Windows platform

Application can be run using the mvn command or running the executable
jar
```$xslt
 mvn -e exec:java  -Dexec.mainClass=com.span.devtest.LeagueTrackerApp

```

User will be prompted for input option  
'**F**' for file upload   
'**I**' to input values on console   

**File Upload**   
If environment variable(**SCAN_DATA_DIR**) is set to a location where data files 
are stored, the user only needs to enter the filename. If not set, the full path needs to be entered when prompted

```

### Tests
Test cases are included in source `<PROJECT_HOME>/src/test/java` and the test data files
`<PROJECT_HOME>/src/test/resources/data`  
Some mvn commands to run tests:   
```$xslt
$ mvn test
$ mvn -Dtest=<testname> test
```

### Notes
